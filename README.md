## OpenAI Code Helper
This Python script is designed to assist in modifying code by generating new content based on user input prompts using the OpenAI API.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenAI API key
## Installation
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Install the required packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable named OPENAI_API_KEY.
## Usage
1. Run the script with the name of the file you want to modify as an argument. Example: 
```
python openai_code_helper.py example.py
```
2. The current content of the file will be displayed, followed by a prompt asking for instructions on what should be changed. 
The prompt should follow the format: 
```
[Code]<here is the code>\n[Prompt]<here is some instruction what should be changed in the code>
```
3. If a prompt is provided, the script will generate new content based on the prompt and replace the original file content with the new content.
## Code Explanation
The script performs the following actions:

1. Imports the required modules: sys, os, and openai.
2. Initializes the OpenAI API client with the API key provided as an environment variable.
3. Defines a function generate_new_content() that generates new code based on the prompt using the OpenAI API.
4. Defines the main function main() which reads the content of the file, prompts the user for instructions, generates new content based on the prompt, and writes the new content to the file.
5. Checks if the script is being run as the main program, and if so, calls the main() function.
